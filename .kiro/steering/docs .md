## File Organization

### Documentation Structure
```
docs/
├── api/                 # API endpoint documentation
├── collections/         # Collection schema docs
├── components/          # Component usage guides
├── deployment/          # Deployment and infrastructure
├── development/         # Development setup and workflows
└── examples/           # Code examples and tutorials
```

### Naming Conventions
- Use kebab-case for file names
- Include version numbers for API docs
- Use descriptive folder names that match code structure
- Keep README files in each major directory

## Content Guidelines

### Code Examples
- Always include working, tested code examples
- Use realistic data in examples, not foo/bar placeholders
- Include both success and error scenarios
- Provide complete context, not just snippets

### Screenshots and Diagrams
- Include screenshots of admin UI for custom components
- Use diagrams to explain complex data relationships
- Keep images up-to-date with UI changes
- Use consistent styling and annotations

### Version Management
- Document breaking changes prominently
- Include migration guides for major updates
- Use semantic versioning for documentation releases
- Maintain changelog for significant documentation updates

## Review and Maintenance

### Documentation Reviews
- Include documentation updates in code review process
- Verify examples work with current codebase
- Check for outdated links and references
- Ensure consistency with project coding standards

### Automated Checks
- Use linting tools for markdown consistency
- Validate code examples in CI/CD pipeline
- Check for broken internal and external links
- Generate API docs automatically from code comments
